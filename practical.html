						<h3>Reservations</h3>
						<img src="imgs/praktisch-1.jpg">
						<p>You can make a reservation by contacting us, preferably by email. We ask an advance payment of 25% of the total rent to confirm your reservation, or one month's rent in case of longer rental periods.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="practical_img">
						<h3>Costs</h3>
						<img src="imgs/praktisch-2.jpg">
						<p>The indicated rates include use of electricity, gas and water, use of wireless internet, TV distribution and insurance. The city of Ghent imposes a city tax of 2.5€ per night per person older than 12. Children younger than 12 stay at half price.</p>
					
					</div>


					<div class="practical_img">
						<h3>Payments</h3>
						<img src="imgs/praktisch-3.jpg">
						<p>We prefer to handle all payments by bank transfer or Paypal. We ask our tenants to settle the balance at the start of their lease. This balance is of course the total rent minus the advance payment. In case of longer rental periods these payments can also be done periodically, eg. every month, but we also ask to do this at the beginning of each period.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="practical_img">
						<h3>Paperwork</h3>
						<img src="imgs/praktisch-4.jpg">
						<p>To reduce the paperwork to a minimum, we proceed as follows: we will send you a signed lease, you return one signed copy by email. The lease includes the details of your reservation and a listing of the rental conditions under which we rent out our apartments.</p>
